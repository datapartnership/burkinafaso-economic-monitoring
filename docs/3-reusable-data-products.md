# Data Products: Examples

**Reusable Data Products** are produced using the **Foundational Datasets** and can be further used to generate indicators and insights. All Data Products include documentation, references to original data sources (and/or information on how to access them), and a description of their limitations.

Each Data Product is produced according to the following outline:

1. Data Product Overview

2. Data Description

3. Methodology (with code)

4. Findings

5. Limitations

6. References

The following chapters include example Data Products prepared by the Lab for World Bank task teams.

| A    | Observed Changes in NightLight Data in Gaza and Jordan       | Weekly aggregated trends in nighttime luminosity             | Changes in nighttime lights could be driven by multiple factors—such as rescue efforts generating lights, to damages and people leaving high-hit areas causing a reduction in nighttime lights |
| B    | Observed Impact of Gaza Conflict Events on Specific Land Uses and Points of Interst | Bi-weekly update of radar-detected damages and conflict events overlayed with Gaza points of interest and land use. | The points of interest, roads, and land use data are obtained from OSM, which is crowdsourced and does not have a fixed refresh schedule. The building footprints are derived from the Microsoft Global Building Footprint dataset and are generated by AI and prone to over-sampling. |
